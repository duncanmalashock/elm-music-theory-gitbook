# Goals for a demo

### Classical example 1

A user:

* writes a harmonic progression and melody
* harmonizes it into a SATB chorale in homophonic texture choosing from classical voice leading options \(including inversions\)
* projects the chorale onto an accompaniment texture
* \(or\) projects the chorale into a three-part polyphonic texture, choosing from classical options of non-chord tones
