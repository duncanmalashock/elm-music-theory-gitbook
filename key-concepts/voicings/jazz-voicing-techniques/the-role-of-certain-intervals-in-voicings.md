# The role of certain intervals in voicings

## Intervals add more interest than alterations do

Counterintuitively, the inclusion of the minor second and/or major seventh intervals in a voicing does more to add tension than the inclusion of altered extensions.

## "Quartal" voicings have a particular character

Forming voicings using primarily the perfect fourth interval adds a "resonant" character and increases the functional ambiguity of a chord voicing; this technique is often [used in late 20th-century jazz fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartal_and_quintal_harmony#Jazz).
