# Spread voicings

Spread voicings are similar to drop voicings, but they are constructed **starting from the root as the bottom voice**. This makes them more dramatic because of the low root and clearly defined harmony.

**Note: spread voicings are not an option if the root is in the lead voice.**

## Four-way spread voicings

Here is the method for constructing four-way spread voicings:

1. Place the root of the chord \(**not a substitute** in the Root category\) in the fourth \(bottom\) voice.
2. Place the 3rd, 5th \(**not a substitute** from the 5th category\), or 7th of the chord in the third voice.
3. Place the remaining 3rd or 7th of the chord that was not used in step 2 in the second voice.
4. Choose any remaining chord factor to place in the first voice that was not used in the previous steps.

Here is an example **four-way spread** voicing of a Cmaj6/9 chord:

| Pitch | Factor | Category |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| D5 | Major 9th | Root |
| E4 | Major 3rd | 3rd |
| A3 | Major 6th | 7th |
| C3 | Root | Root |

## Five-way spread voicings

There are a few methods for constructing five-way spread voicings, some of which can produce identical results in some cases:

### Method 1 \(based on four-way spread method\)

1. Place the root of the chord \(**not a substitute** in the Root category\) in the fifth \(bottom\) voice.
2. Place the 3rd, 5th \(**not a substitute** from the 5th category\), or 7th of the chord in the fourth voice.
3. Place the remaining 3rd or 7th of the chord that was not used in step 2 in the third voice.
4. Choose any remaining chord factors to place in the second and first voices that was not used in the previous steps.

### Method 2 \("drop-2 spread", based on drop-2 voicing\)

1. Create a four-way drop-2 voicing, but use a **substitute root** from the Root category.
2. Add the true root below in the fifth voice.

### Method 3 \("quasi-spread", based on four-way close voicing\)

1. Create a four-way close voicing, but use a **substitute root** from the Root category.
2. Add the true root below in the fifth voice.
