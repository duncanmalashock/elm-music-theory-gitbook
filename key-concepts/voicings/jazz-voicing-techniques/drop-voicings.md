# Drop voicings

Drop voicings are the same as **four-way close voicings, but with one or more of their voices transposed an octave down** \("dropped\). This makes the voicing "open" or "semi-open", depending on the technique, because of the larger intervals between voices.

There are three kinds of drop voicings:

| Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Drop-2 | Second voice is dropped |
| Drop-3 | Third voice is dropped |
| Drop-2-4 | Second and fourth voices are both dropped |

Here is an example of a **drop-2 voicing** of a C7 chord \(dropped 2nd voice is in **bold**\):

| Pitch | Factor | Category |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| E5 | Major 3rd | 3rd |
| B♭4 | Minor 7th | 7th |
| G4 | Perfect 5th | 5th |
| **C4** | **Root** | **Root** |

Here is the same C7 chord as a **drop-2-4 voicing** \(dropped voices are in **bold**\):

| Pitch | Factor | Category |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| E5 | Major 3rd | 3rd |
| B♭4 | Minor 7th | 7th |
| **C4** | **Root** | **Root** |
| **G3** | **Perfect 5th** | **5th** |
