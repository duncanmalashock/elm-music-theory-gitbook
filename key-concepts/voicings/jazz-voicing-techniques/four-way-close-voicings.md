# Four-way close voicings

"Four-way close" voicings are, as the name implies, **close voicings** \(with chord factors close together\) **with four voices**. 

The method for a four-way close voicing is:

1. **Start at the top**, choosing a "lead" pitch for the top voice, and determine its category.
2. Proceed downward, through the categories in order \(Root, 7th, 5th, 3rd\), **adding one pitch from each category**.
3. Avoid the interval of a minor or major second between the lead and second voice.

Here are the order of the voice categories in each case:

| Root in lead | 7th in lead | 5th in lead | 3rd in lead |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Root category | 7th category | 5th category | 3rd category |
| 7th category | 5th category | 3rd category | Root category |
| 5th category | 3rd category | Root category | 7th category |
| 3rd category | Root category | 7th category | 5th category |

Here is an example four-way close voicing of a Cmaj6/9 chord:

| Pitch | Factor | Category |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| E5 | Major 3rd | 3rd |
| C5 | Root | Root |
| A4 | Major 6th | 7th |
| G4 | Perfect 5th | 5th |
