# Jazz conventions

Before we get into these techniques and how they work, here are some principles that should clarify how chords are treated in jazz theory.

## Guide tones

Jazz musicians think in terms of **sixth and seventh chords** as their preferred ways to harmonize a piece of music at all times.

The **third and sixth/seventh factors** of these chords are thought of as the factors that most **irreducibly define the quality of these chords**, and are called _guide tones_ by jazz musicians.

## "Available tensions"

After establishing the guide tones as the basis of a chord, jazz musicians will **add other chord tones, extensions, and alterations** \(which are sometimes called _"available tensions"_ in jazz education programs like the Berklee school, although this term can appear vague and misleading\) as they feel are appropriate.

Jazz musicians think in terms of adding "available tensions" to a base form of a chord, but in a strict sense, this is **a process of taking an initial chord** \(ex. Cmaj7\) and **substituting it with another that serves a similar purpose** \(ex. C6/9\). 

We will want some way of making these substitutions in this library when voicing common jazz chord types like major, minor, and dominant sevenths.

The rules for how to make these substitutions are sometimes unclear, and are often a matter of convention, but they are related to the concepts of how chords ands scales relate, and how tension and release work in the context of chord progressions. We'll go over both these topics in the future.
