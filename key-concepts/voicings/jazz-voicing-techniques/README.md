# Jazz voicing techniques

At this point it should make sense how close and open voicings and inversions can be applied to chords with three or four factors. But as we covered earlier, jazz chords with extensions and alterations, like C13\(-9\), can include up to seven factors! **How should a composer choose which ones to use and which to leave out?**

Jazz arrangers have developed practical techniques over the years for **voicing chords for groups of four or five instruments**, which can go a long way in answering questions about which factors to include, how to place the voices to sound balanced, and how to accentuate the feelings of tension and rest in certain chords.

We'll go over some of those techniques here, with the goal of implementing algorithms to apply them to a chord. The techniques in this section are taken from [Jazz Arranging Techniques](https://lindsayjazz.com/jazz-arranging-techniques/) by Prof. Gary Lindsay from the University of Miami.
