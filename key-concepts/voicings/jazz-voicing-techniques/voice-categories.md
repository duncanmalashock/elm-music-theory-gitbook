# Voice categories

In his book [Jazz Arranging Techniques](https://lindsayjazz.com/jazz-arranging-techniques/), Prof. Gary Lindsay describes a way of classifying a chord factors for one of the four most common chord types into one of four "categories". Each of these categories contain possible substitutes for the root, third, fifth, and seventh factors of a seventh chord:

| Chord type | Root category | 3rd category | 5th category | 7th category |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Maj7 | Root, 9th | 3rd | 5th, ♯11th | 7th, 6th |
| Min7 | Root, 9th | 3rd | 5th, 11th | 7th |
| Min7\(♭5\) | Root, 9th, 11th | 3rd | ♭5th | 7th |
| Dom7 | Root, 9th,♭9th, ♯9th | 3rd, sus4 | 5th, ♯11th, 13th, ♭13th | 7th |

This categorization method forms the basis for many of the techniques we'll look at next.

As we discussed, jazz musicians often speak in terms of "available tensions" for use in a chord, although technically these substitutions transform one chord type into another.
