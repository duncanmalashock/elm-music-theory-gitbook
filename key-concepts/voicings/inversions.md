# Inversions

An [inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_%28music%29#Root_position_and_inverted_chords) is a term that applies to voicings of triads and seventh chords where **a chord factor other than the root is used in the lowest voice**.

[First inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_inversion) means a triad or seventh chord with its third factor in the lowest voice:

Ex.: C major, 1st inversion: E G C

[Second inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_inversion) means a triad or seventh chord with its fifth factor in the lowest voice:

Ex.: C minor, 2nd inversion: G C E♭

[Third inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_inversion) means a seventh chord \(since seventh chords have four factors\) with its seventh factor in the lowest voice:

Ex.: C7, 3rd inversion: B♭, C, E, G

[Inversions above third](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversions_higher_than_third) exist as well for chords with more factors, such as jazz chords, but it's not clear to me whether jazz musicians apply the inversion concept in the same way when some factors will not be included in the voicing.

**Inversions only describe the bass voice**

\(E G C\) is a common example for a C major triad in first inversion, but \(E C G\), \(E G C E\), \(E C E G\) etc. are all valid voicings of a first inversion C major triad too.
