# Validation criteria for voicings

Once a chord has been voiced, there are criteria a voicing must commonly pass in order to be considered a usable option. Here are the ones I am aware of:

## Low interval limits

Low interval limits are a set of guidelines. They define the lowest pitches at which an interval can be clearly perceived without sounding muddy or indistinct, due to their overtones clashing. It's sometimes acceptable for a voicing to violate low interval limit guidelines if they allow for better voice leading \(which we'll discuss later\).

Here is the list of low interval limit guidelines:

| Interval | Lowest bass note |
| :--- | :--- |
| Minor second | E3 |
| Major second | E♭3 |
| Minor third | C3 |
| Major third | B♭2 |
| Perfect fourth | B♭2 |
| Augmented fourth | B♭2 |
| Perfect fifth | B♭1 |
| Minor sixth | G2 |
| Major sixth | F2 |
| Minor seventh | F2 |
| Major seventh | F2 |
| Minor ninth | E2 |
| Major ninth | E♭2 |
| Minor tenth | C2 |
| Major tenth | B♭1 |

## The "minor ninth" rule

> The minor ninth interval is effective when created by combining a low root with a ♭9 tension above, as in a dominant 7\(♭9\) chord. However, there are many other ways of forming this interval that create voicings uncommon to traditional non-modal jazz harmony. Voicings containing the minor ninth interval are generally not as practical...because they are unstable and tend to obscure the function of the harmony.

## The "adjacent seconds" rule

> Formally stated, intervals above and below a minor second should not be any larger than an augmented fourth. These voicings can be difficult to blend and balance with horns as a result of the spacing.
