# Close and open voicings

The examples we've seen so far have all been "[close voicings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_and_open_harmony)" \("close" is pronounced as in "close proximity"\). Although these terms are somewhat relative, **"close" voicings have comparatively smaller intervals** between chord factors, and **"open" voicings have larger intervals**.

### In classical music

In classical music, the definition is similar but distinct: close voicings are ones where **the non-bass voices are within the span of an octave**, and open voicings have **the non-bass voices within the span of two or more octaves**.

### In jazz music

In jazz music, close voicings are ones where **all voices are within the span of an octave**, regardless of inversion:

Ex. C major seventh, 2nd inversion, in close voicing: G3, B3, C4, E4

And open voicings have their voices **within the span of two or more octaves**:

Ex. C major seventh, root position, in open voicing: C3, G3, E4, B4
