# Voicings

We've said before that a chord is a root and a set of pitch classes which represent its factors. **A** [_**voicing**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voicing_%28music%29) **is an instance of those pitch classes as pitches, in a certain order.**

Different voicings can be used to emphasize certain chord factors over others, and create feelings of tension or rest through the intervals used.

In this section we'll look at different ways chords can be voiced in practice.
