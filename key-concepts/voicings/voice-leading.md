# Voice leading

The term [_"voice leading"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_leading) refers to the method of writing the voices of a chord progression as a group of melodic lines that move independently and blend well with one another. The term comes from arranging music for human voices to sing.

### **Voice leading strategies are style-specific**

The voice leading strategies of a typical composer in the 18th century like Haydn would be different from those of a 19th-century composer like Debussy, because their techniques worked in support of different artistic goals. And in the 20th century, jazz or popular music followed different strategies too. But voice leading techniques share the same basic principles.

### General principles of voice leading

#### Melodic lines should be smooth:

* Primarily move by steps \(major or minor seconds\)
* Avoid intervals that are difficult to sing \(e.g. augmented second\)
* Correctly handle "tendency tones": \(e.g. 7ths should resolve downward by step to 3rds of the following chord\)

#### Melodic lines should be independent:

* Voices should not move together in parallel fifths and octaves \(not as common after the 19th century\)
* Voices should use contrary motion when possible
