# Decisions when choosing a voicing

We've covered a lot of choices involved in voicing a chord. Here is my best attempt to frame them in terms of required vs. optional choices:

### Required choices

* How many voices should a voicing have?
* Within what pitch range should the parts be limited \(e.g. to fit within instrument ranges, or to avoid clashing with a melody\)?
* Which voicing technique\(s\) should be used \(e.g. four-way close, four-way spread, drop-2, etc.\)?

### Optional choices

* Does a specific chord factor need to be used in a particular voice \(e.g. in the bass for an inversion, or in the top voice for harmonizing a melody\)?
* Should particular available tensions be preferred \(e.g. 13 instead of 5\)?
* Should a particular interval or intervals be preferred \(e.g. minor seconds & major sevenths for "tension", or perfect fourths for the "quartal sound"\)?
* Should a particular set of these options be favored based on how well the result adheres to voice leading rules with the chord voicing that came before it?
* Should voicing options be checked against validation criteria like low interval limit guidelines and/or "adjacent seconds" and "minor ninth" rules?
