# Root position

The example of chords we've been looking at in the last section have all had their factors ordered as though they were voiced in [_root position_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_position).

The term "root position" describes voicings that use **the root as the lowest** _**voice**_. A "voice" refers to a pitch used in a voicing.
