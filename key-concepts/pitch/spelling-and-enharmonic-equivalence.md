# Spelling and enharmonic equivalence

The pitch class C-sharp \(C♯\), then, is a pitch class between C and D. But D-flat \(D♭\), is also a pitch class between C and D. **Both pitch classes sound the same**, but are "spelled" with a different note name and a different accidental.

Pitch classes that are spelled differently but represent the same sound are called [_enharmonic equivalents_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enharmonic).

Natural pitch classes can also be respelled using accidentals: C and B♯ sound the same, as do F and E♯. These pitch classes may seem like theoretical curiosities, but they are used all the time in compositions.

You may be asking yourself at this point why musicians simply don't use twelve distinct pitch class names instead of introducing redundancy into their incomplete letter-name model. 

The answer is that **musicians think, most of the time, in terms of a seven-pitch-class** _**scale**_, which represents each pitch class as a separate letter name with the required accidentals.

Scales will be covered in more detail later, but here is an example of a common use of an enharmonic spelling: the pitch classes in the F♯ major scale:

F♯, G♯, A♯, B, C♯, D♯, E♯

The use of an E♯ avoids a situation where there are two Fs \(F and F♯\) in the same scale. This helps musicians think in terms of the mnemonic seven letter-named degrees of a scale, instead of remembering a subset of 12 numbered semitones.

## Multiple accidentals

To make the matter of spelling a pitch class even more complicated, _double accidentals_ like the double-sharp \([![double sharp](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/DoubleSharp.svg/7px-DoubleSharp.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DoubleSharp.svg)\) and double-flat \([![double flat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Doubleflat.svg/8px-Doubleflat.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Doubleflat.svg)\) are used in practice. And **theoretically,** [**any number**](https://ultimatemusictheory.com/triple-flat/) **of flats or sharps could be applied to a letter name** to transform it any number of semitones away from its original value.

Therefore, there are theoretically an **infinite number of enharmonically equivalent pitch classes**, and the matter of spelling a pitch class appropriately depends on a combination of notational convention, the musical context, and the intention of the composer.
