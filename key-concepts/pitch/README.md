# Pitch

_**Pitch**_ **is the quality of a musical tone that makes us perceive it as being "higher" or "lower"**, compared to others. It has a direct \(but [logarithmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies)\) relationship to the [_frequency_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) \(measured in [Hz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz)\) of a periodic sound wave; a sound with a higher frequency has a higher pitch.

## The octave and pitch classes

If two pitches have a frequency relationship of 2:1 \(for example, 440Hz and 220Hz\), they are said to be an [_octave_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave) apart. **Pitches at any number of octaves to each other are perceived as the "same"** in a way, even though they are higher or lower. This is called [_octave equivalence_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave#Equivalence), and it means that pitches can be thought of as having the same quality \(which is called "chroma" in the field of psychoacoustics\), as [_pitch classes_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class), regardless of the octave they are in.

So **pitch classes are pitches regardless of octave**. Let's take a closer look at their properties.
