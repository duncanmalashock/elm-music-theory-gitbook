# Pitch and octaves

## Pitch is a pitch class with an octave

Returning to our earlier definition of a pitch class, a _pitch_ is a concrete instance of a pitch class within a particular numbered octave, such as C2 or F♯7.

So how many octaves are there?

## Limits of the human auditory response

The [frequency range of human hearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_range), at its most sensitive, is from 20Hz—20kHz, and as a conventional standard, **the standard piano keyboard has 88 pitches, between seven and eight octaves' worth**. The [Scientific Pitch Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation#Table_of_note_frequencies) standard has a twelve-octave range, which extends far past the limits of human hearing.
