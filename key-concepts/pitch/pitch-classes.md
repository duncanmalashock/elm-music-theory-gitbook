# Pitch classes

## Twelve semitones in an octave

For reasons that have mainly to do with the nature of the [harmonic series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_%28music%29) and the benefit of making music [transposable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_%28music%29), the octave in Western music is divided into twelve parts, called [_semitones_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitone). Because of octave equivalence, there are **twelve distinct semitones** in the Western musical system.

These semitones form equal divisions of the octave, so **the difference in pitch between each neighboring division is the same**: a _semitone_. This is a property of the Western tuning system called [equal temperament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament).

## Seven letter names

**By convention, the octave is also divided in terms of seven** _**letter names**_, having [developed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_note#History_of_note_names) from the tones used in the development of church music for voice. From one octave to another, the seven letter names, which repeat at the octave \(which is from the Latin for "eighth"\) are named C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. These letter names are used to name pitch classes.

**The pitch classes represented by these letter names are not evenly spaced**. The distances between each of these letter names are two semitones, except for the distances from E to F, and from B to C; both distances of one semitone. This uneven spacing is not arbitrary: it is the formula for a C major scale \(we'll discuss scales later\).

These pitch classes are known as the "[natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_%28music%29) notes". They are represented by the white keys on a piano keyboard.

## Accidentals

We learned earlier that there are **twelve distinct semitones in the octave, but only seven letter names** that musicians use. How, then, do we represent the remaining five pitch classes besides the naturals?

The musical convention is to use _**accidentals**_**, which are modifiers that add or remove semitones from a letter name.** The basic forms of accidentals are the _sharp_ \(♯\), which adds a semitone, and the _flat_ \(♭\), which removes a semitone. This allows musicians to represent the pitch classes between the natural letter names. 

Another accidental symbol, called the _natural_ \(♮\), is used in music notation to cancel a previous accidental and return the pitch class to its "natural" letter name form \(e.g. to change a C♯ back into C\).
