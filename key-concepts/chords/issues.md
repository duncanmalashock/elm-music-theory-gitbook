## Custom `ChordClass`es currently can't be defined

Custom ChordClasses could be defined via a `fromIntervals` function which took a `List Interval`, or by functions that transform chord factors in more controlled ways \(these exist already as "builder functions" in the `ChordClass` file which are not yet exposed.\)
