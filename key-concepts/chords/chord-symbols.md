# Chord symbols

In jazz and popular music, it's often helpful to use short, easy-to-read symbols to communicate what chords should be played in various parts of a piece. Conventions for [chord symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_letters) vary even more than terminology for chords themselves, with various different preferences available even within the fairly systematic jazz idiom.
