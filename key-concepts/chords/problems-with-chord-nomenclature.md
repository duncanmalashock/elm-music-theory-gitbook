# Complications with chord nomenclature

At this point we could attempt to explain a theory of how chord qualities are defined and how they are used, but we should be aware of some issues with the theory of chords in general.

## The problem of classifying chords

Various music theory texts attempt to describe how chord qualities can be analyzed and classified based on various conventions used in different musical idioms, but there is no unified nomenclature for chord qualities. 

This leaves us with detailed nomenclatures of various chord types that have grown out of classical, jazz, and other musical traditions, leaving a substantial number of remaining chord types which have no names or associated terminology at all. In other words, **there exist no naming conventions which can adequately describe any arbitrary chord in a way that would be useful to a musician**.

So let's look at examples of different conventions for chord types separately before attempting to unify them into one model.
