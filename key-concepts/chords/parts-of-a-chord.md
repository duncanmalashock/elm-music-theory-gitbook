# Parts of a chord

## Chord factors

**The component pitch classes that make up a chord are called chord** [_**factors**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_%28chord%29)**.** They are much like scale degrees, in that they are represented by intervals, and named similarly.

Let's take the C major chord as a simple example. It is made up of the following three factors:

* Its "root", C
* The "third", E \(a major third up from C\)
* The "fifth", G \(a perfect fifth up from C\)

C major is a [triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_%28music%29), which means it has three factors total.

## Tertian harmony

You may notice that each of these chord factors is at a major or minor third interval up from the last. E is a major third up from C, and G is a minor third up from E.

**Building chords up in thirds is called** [**tertian harmony**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertian), and it is the most commonly-understood way \(but [not the only way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartal_and_quintal_harmony)\) chords are constructed and analyzed in tonal music.

{% hint style="info" %}
Why are thirds so popular as a building block for chords? The reason is largely historical, but it may be partially explained by the fact that thirds are found early in the [harmonic series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_%28music%29#Frequencies,_wavelengths,_and_musical_intervals_in_example_systems), after the octave, perfect fifth, and perfect fourth, and the interval distance of a third is smaller than any of these.

## Chord quality

**The specific intervals included in a chord determine what musicians call the chord's** [**quality**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_letters#Chord_quality). In our example, the presence of a major third and a perfect fifth up from its root give it the quality of a "major" triad.

As with relationships between intervals to the tonic of a scale, a chord's quality is distinct from its root; in other words, a C major chord and a D major chord have the same intervals, just like a C major scale and a D major scale do. You could call a chord's quality its "chord class", if you wanted to.

How many chord qualities are there? The answer is complicated...
