# Common chords in classical music

## Triads

Classical music is made mostly of [triads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_%28music%29). A triad, as we learned earlier, is a chord with three [factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_%28chord%29). And the vast majority of triads are built using [tertian harmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertian), as we also covered, using the [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_third) or [minor third](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_third) intervals to determine its factors. There are four combinations of the major and minor third, and they form the following triads:

### Major

A major triad \(named for its "major" third factor\) uses the formula of:

* Root
* Major third \(a major third up from the root\)
* Perfect fifth \(a minor third up from the third\)

Ex.: A C major chord has the chord factors C, E, and G.

### Minor

Similarly, a minor triad uses the formula of:

* Root
* Minor third \(a minor third up from the root\)
* Perfect fifth \(a major third up from the third\)

Ex.: A C minor chord has the chord factors C, E♭, and G.

### Diminished

A diminished triad \(named for its "diminished" fifth factor\) uses the formula of two minor third intervals:

* Root
* Minor third \(a minor third up from the root\)
* Diminished fifth \(a minor third up from the third\)

Ex.: A C diminished chord has the chord factors C, E♭, and G♭.

### Augmented

A augmented triad \(named for its "augmented" fifth factor\) uses the formula of two major third intervals:

* Root
* Major third \(a major third up from the root\)
* Augmented fifth \(a major third up from the third\)

Ex.: A C diminished chord has the chord factors C, E, and G♯.

## Suspended triads

**A** [**suspended chord**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_chord) **is a major or minor triad with its third factor replaced with a second or fourth**. It comes from the counterpoint technique of "[suspension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonchord_tone#Suspension_and_retardation)" from which it takes its name.

A suspension usually refers to a _suspended fourth_ \(in which the third factor is replaced with a perfect fourth\):

Ex.: C suspended fourth: C F G

...or a _suspended second_ \(in which the third factor is replaced with a major second\).

Ex.: C suspended second: C D G

Since neither the major second nor the perfect fourth interval is a third, the suspended \(or "sus"\) chord is a common exception to the principle of constructing chords using [tertian harmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertian), or a "non-tertian" chord.

## Seventh chords

The most common chords with four factors are, surprisingly, called [seventh chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_chord), and not "tetrads". The name refers to the seventh interval used for determining the fourth factor.

There are many different possible [combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_chord#Tertian) of major and minor thirds that could be used to build up seventh chords. Here are two of the most common in classical music:

### Dominant seventh chords

A [dominant seventh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_seventh_chord) chord is named for the "dominant function" it performs in tonal harmony \(we'll cover chord function in a later section\). The formula for a dominant seventh chord is:

* Root
* Major third \(a minor third up from the root\)
* Perfect fifth \(a minor third up from the third\)
* Minor seventh \(a minor third up from the fifth\)

Ex.: A C dominant seventh chord has the chord factors C, E, G, and B♭.

### Diminished seventh chords

A [diminished seventh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_seventh_chord) chord is named for its [diminished seventh interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminished_seventh) \(an enharmonic equivalent to a major sixth\). It is just like a diminished triad, but with another factor added a minor third above. The formula for a dominant seventh chord is:

* Root
* Minor third \(a minor third up from the root\)
* Diminished fifth \(a minor third up from the third\)
* Diminished seventh \(a minor third up from the fifth\)

Ex.: A C diminished seventh chord has the chord factors C, E, G♭, and B♭♭.
