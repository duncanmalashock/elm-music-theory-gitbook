# Chords

**A chord is a set of pitch classes that are played simultaneously** to form what is known in the Western musical system as [harmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony).

Chords are used in tonal music to do two things:

1. Chords create a "background" or "harmonic context" that changes how the notes of a melody are heard.
2. Changing chords over time create the perception of tension and relaxation, which helps define the perceived key of a piece of music.
