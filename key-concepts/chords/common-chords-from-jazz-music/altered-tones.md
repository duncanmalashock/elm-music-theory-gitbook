# Altered tones

Since the [bebop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebop) era of the early 1940s, altered chords have become standard features of jazz harmony. The [alterations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_chord#Alt_chord) refer to including **a raised or lowered fifth, ninth, eleventh, or thirteenth factors of a seventh chord**. Here are the options available, as they are normally called, and their corresponding intervals from the root:

* "Flat five" \(diminished fifth\)
* "Sharp five" \(augmented fifth\)
* "Flat nine" \(minor ninth\)
* "Sharp nine" \(augmented ninth\)
* "Sharp eleven" \(augmented eleventh\)
* "Flat thirteen" \(minor thirteenth\)

By jazz convention, these factors are named "flat" and "sharp", by convention, relative to the degrees that would normally be found in a major scale.

Seventh chords can include any combination of these alterations, although some express enharmonically equivalent pitch classes. For instance, "flat thirteen" and "sharp five" chord factors are different way of expressing identical sounds\).

## Interaction with extensions

In jazz terminology, **chords are named for their highest unaltered extension**, or the seventh if no unaltered extensions are present. A dominant chord with only a flat thirteenth would be a "dominant seven, flat thirteen" chord.

### Examples

Here are some common altered chord types:

#### Major seventh, sharp eleven

* C \(Root\)
* E \(Major third\)
* G \(Perfect fifth\)
* B \(Major seventh\)
* F♯\(Augmented eleventh\)

#### Dominant seventh, sharp nine, flat thirteen

* C \(Root\)
* E \(Major third\)
* G \(Perfect fifth\)
* B♭\(Minor seventh\)
* D♯ \(Augmented ninth\)
* A♭\(Minor thirteenth\)

#### Dominant nine, sharp eleven

* C \(Root\)
* E \(Major third\)
* G \(Perfect fifth\)
* B♭\(Minor seventh\)
* D \(Major ninth\)
* F♯ \(Augmented eleventh\)
