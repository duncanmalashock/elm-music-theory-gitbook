# Common chords in jazz music

## Chords with four factors

As opposed to classical harmony, where chords are mainly triads, **chords in jazz are mainly made of four factors**. They fall into these categories:

### Seventh chords

Dominant and diminished seventh chords like the ones we described in classical music are used in jazz, as well as other forms of seventh chords. These vary mainly in terms of whether the third and seventh intervals used are major or minor.

#### **Major seventh**

* Root
* Major third
* Perfect fifth
* Major seventh

Ex: C [major seventh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_seventh_chord): C, E, G, B

#### **Minor seventh**

* Root
* Minor third
* Perfect fifth
* Minor seventh

Ex: C [minor seventh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_seventh_chord): C, E♭, G, B♭

#### **Minor seventh, flat five \(or half-diminished\)**

* Root
* Minor third
* Diminished fifth
* Minor seventh

Ex: C [half-diminished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-diminished_seventh_chord): C, E♭, G♭, B♭

#### **Minor major seventh**

A misleading name: the "minor" refers to the minor third interval, and the "major seventh" refers to the major seventh interval.

* Root
* Minor third
* Diminished fifth
* Major seventh

Ex: C [minor major seventh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_major_seventh_chord): C, E♭, G, B

#### **Dominant seventh sus4**

* Root
* Perfect fourth
* Perfect fifth
* Minor seventh

Ex: C [dominant seventh sus4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_chord#Jazz_sus_chord): C, F, G, B♭

### Sixth chords

[Sixth chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_chord#In_popular_music) have four factors, but include a **sixth interval instead of a seventh**. This makes them exceptions to the rule of [tertian harmony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertian). There are two kinds of sixth chords:

#### Major sixth

* Root
* Major third
* Perfect fifth
* Major sixth

Ex: C major sixth: C, E, G, A

#### Minor sixth

* Root
* Minor third
* Perfect fifth
* Major sixth

Ex: C minor sixth: C, E♭, G, A
