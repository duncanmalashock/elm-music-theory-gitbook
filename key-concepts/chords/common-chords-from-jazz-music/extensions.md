# Extensions

A unique feature of jazz harmony is its use of chordal [_extensions_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_chord) on seventh chords.

## What an extension is

**An extension is a** [**tertian**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertian) **chord factor after the seventh.** If we keep building up chord factors in thirds after the seventh, we arrive at the following [compound intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29#Compound_intervals):

* Root
* Third
* Fifth
* Seventh
* **Ninth**
* **Eleventh**
* **Thirteenth**

The ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chord factors are the **extensions** of a jazz chord. **Extensions do not continue past the thirteenth**, because at that point all seven letter names of the major scale have been accounted for.

### Examples

#### Dominant thirteenth

A C dominant thirteenth chord would include the four factors in the C dominant seventh chord it is based on, and all the extensions between the seventh and the thirteenth.

* C \(Root\)
* E \(Major third\)
* G \(Perfect fifth\)
* B♭\(Minor seventh\)
* D \(Major ninth\)
* F \(Perfect eleventh\)
* A \(Major thirteenth\)

By default, the ninth is major, the eleventh is perfect, and the thirteenth is major, regardless of the quality of the seventh chord being extended. These are the degrees that would be found in the major scale.

#### Major ninth

A C major ninth chord would include the four factors in the C major seventh chord it is based on, and all the extensions between the seventh and the ninth \(which in this case is only the ninth\).

* C \(Root\)
* E \(Major third\)
* G \(Perfect fifth\)
* B \(Major seventh\)
* D \(Major ninth\)

## Extensions used with sixth chords

Since sixth chords are non-[tertian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertian), this is more of an exception, but sixth chords are often used with the inclusion of a major ninth. These are called [6/9 chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_chord#6/9_chord), and there are two versions:

#### Major 6/9

* C \(Root\)
* E \(Major third\)
* G \(Perfect fifth\)
* A \(Major sixth\)
* D \(Major ninth\)

#### Minor 6/9

* C \(Root\)
* E♭\(Minor third\)
* G \(Perfect fifth\)
* A \(Major sixth\)
* D \(Major ninth\)
