# What intervals are and how they work

In order to transpose a pitch with no ambiguity, we need to specify a measurement that describes **how both the letter name and accidentals should change**. This is the idea behind the [_interval_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29).

## Parts of an interval

An interval is made up of:

* A _number_, which indicates a **distance in letter name**
* A _quality_, which determines the **distance in total number of semitones**
* A _direction_, which indicates whether an interval would add or subtract semitone value

## Interval numbers

There are _simple_ _intervals_, spanning **an octave at most**, and _compound_ _intervals_, which can be expressed as **one or more octaves** **plus a simple interval**. The simple interval numbers are:

* Unison \(same letter name\)
* Second \(+1 letter name\)
* Third \(+2 letter names\)
* Fourth \(+3 letter names\)
* Fifth \(+4 letter names\)
* Sixth \(+5 letter names\)
* Seventh \(+6 letter names\)
* Octave \(same letter name\)

## Interval quality

### Perfect and imperfect qualities

There are two categories of interval quality—_perfect_ and _imperfect—_which depend on the interval number.

The unison, fourth, fifth, and octave are so-called [_perfect_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29#Perfect) _intervals_. The rest are [imperfect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29#Major_and_minor), which means their quality can be either _major_ or _minor_.

Here are the simple **perfect**, **major**, and **minor** intervals and their semitone values:

| Interval name | Semitones |
| :--- | :--- |
| Perfect unison | 0 |
| Minor second | 1 |
| Major second | 2 |
| Minor third | 3 |
| Major third | 4 |
| Perfect fourth | 5 |
| Perfect fifth | 7 |
| Minor sixth | 8 |
| Major sixth | 9 |
| Minor seventh | 10 |
| Major seventh | 11 |
| Perfect octave | 12 |

### Augmented and diminished qualities

Any interval, whether major, minor, or perfect, can be [_augmented_ or _diminished_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_%28music%29#Augmented_and_diminished), which adds an additional flat or sharp. You can think of augmentation as starting from a perfect or major interval, and diminishment as starting from a perfect or minor interval.

A few examples of **augmented** and **diminished** intervals and their semitone values:

| Interval name | Semitones |
| :--- | :--- |
| Augmented unison | 1 |
| Augmented second | 3 |
| Augmented third | 5 |
| Augmented fourth | 6 |
| Diminished fifth | 6 |
| Augmented fifth | 8 |
| Diminished sixth | 7 |
| Diminished seventh | 9 |
| Diminished octave | 11 |

## Examples of transposition using intervals

A **perfect fifth** up from C4 is G4. G is four letter names after C. G4 is already 7 semitones up from C4, so the accidental does not need to change.

A **minor third** up from C4 is E♭4. E is two letter names after C. E4 is 4 semitones up from C4, so a flat is added in order to meet the target of 3 semitones.

An **augmented third** up from C4 is E♯4. E is two letter names after C. E4 is 4 semitones up from C4, so a sharp is added in order to meet the target of 5 semitones.

A **diminished seventh** up from C4 is B♭♭4. B is six letter names after C. B4 is 11 semitones up from C4, so two flats are added in order to meet the target of 9 semitones.
