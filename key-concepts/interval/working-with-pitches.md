# Working with pitches

## Comparing pitches

We've said that pitch is the quality of a musical tone that makes us perceive it as being "higher" or "lower" compared to another. So **how do we compare two pitches?**

We can convert both of them to semitones and compare those numbers. For instance:

If we measure from the beginning of octave 0, C4 has 48 semitones, and F♯4 has 54 semitones, so F♯ is 6 semitones above C4.

## Transposition

This is fine for comparing pitches, but **what if we want to move a pitch upward or downward by a certain amount?** In music terminology, this is called [transposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_%28music%29).

We've established that, by convention, pitches are specified using letter names and accidentals, and that **there are multiple ways to "spell" a pitch** with the same semitone value.

This poses a problem if we try to transpose a pitch by a number of semitones. If we move C4 up by one semitone, what is the new pitch called? Is it C♯4, or D♭4? Wouldn't it be just as theoretically sound to name it with multiple accidentals, like B♯♯3, or E♭♭♭4?

How can we specify how to transpose a note in a way that gives us **only one clear solution?**
