# Example: the C major scale

We've discussed the **C major scale** earlier as the origin of the pitch class letter names. Let's use it as our first example.

## Parts of a scale

### Degrees

The pitch classes in the C major scale are: C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. Pitch classes in a scale are **within the interval of an octave**, and are called _degrees._ 

### Tonic

Degrees are ordered by interval from the first degree or _tonic_. **C is the tonic of the C major scale**.

### Scale type

The C major scale has seven degrees. Musicians call these types of scales _heptatonic_ scales. Here are the naming conventions for the most common types of scales:

* Octatonic: 8 degrees
* Heptatonic: 7 degrees
* Hexatonic: 6 degrees
* Pentatonic: 5 degrees

There are scales of other numbers of degrees, such as 4, 12, and even 1. I think 1- and 4-degree scales are not of much practical use, and the 12-degree chromatic scale, which contains all 12 semitones, has only one instance, regardless of tonic.

You may be wondering where the major scale came from. So am I! Many people have tried to trace the development of the major scale, but its origins are so distant that we may never understand how it was originally created. I think the best we can say is that it is as much a product of physical phenomena \(e.g. the [harmonic series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_%28music%29)\) as it is a product of cultural processes.
