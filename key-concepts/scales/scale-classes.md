# Scale classes

If we look at the degrees of the C major scale, we can determine their intervals from the tonic:

* C to D: Major second
* C to E: Major third
* C to F: Perfect fourth
* C to G: Perfect fifth
* C to A: Major sixth
* C to B: Major seventh

The intervals that make up the C major scale are the same for any major scale. So **this pattern of intervals can be thought of as a formula for a major scale,** or a _scale class_, as I'll be calling it \(musicians, unfortunately, do not use any term to distinguish between the pattern for a scale and an instance of it starting on a specific tonic\).

As you'd expect, if we transpose the pitch class D by the intervals of the major scale class, we get the degrees of the D major scale. They are D, E, F♯, G, A, B, and C♯.

There are many kinds of scales, but major and minor are particularly important especially in defining the idea of musical key, which we'll go over in a future section.
