# Modes

[Modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_%28music%29#Modern_modes) are **scales derived from a parent scale** by choosing one of its degrees as the new tonic.

For example, the second mode of C major is called D Dorian, and its pitch classes are the same, but they begin at D instead of C. They are D, E, F, G, A, B, and C. Compare their intervals \(or "scale type"\) to those of C major, and you'll see they are different:

* D to E: Major second
* D to F: Minor third
* D to G: Perfect fourth
* D to A: Perfect fifth
* D to B: Major sixth
* D to C: Minor seventh

Even though **they contain the same pitch classes as C major, they arrive at them by a different pattern of intervals**. To see how it is different from C major, here are the pitch classes in C Dorian: C, D, E♭, F, G, A, B♭.

Each of the modes of the major scale has a name, derived from the related scales from ancient Greek music:

* Ionian: 1st mode \(same as major scale\)
* Dorian: 2nd mode
* Phrygian: 3rd mode
* Lydian: 4th mode
* Mixolydian: 5th mode
* Aeolian: 6th mode \(same as minor scale\)
* Locrian: 7th mode

Modes of the major scale are used in many ways, but the most significant relationship worth pointing out here is that the [minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale) is a mode of the major scale; they contain the same pitch classes but have different tonics.

We've gone over the modes of the major scale, but you can derive the modes of any scale.
