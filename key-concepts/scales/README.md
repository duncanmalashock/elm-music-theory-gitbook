# Scales

Scales seem to have been a central part of Western music for such a long time that it's hard to explain them from first principles. The simplest way to describe a [_scale_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_%28music%29) is that it is a **set of pitch classes in a certain order**, and to say that scales exist in order to categorize certain pitches as being related in some way.

This idea of pitch relationships, particularly as defined by the [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_scale#Major_scale) and [minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diatonic_scale#Natural_minor_scale) scalesâ€”plays a very significant role in Western music, especially in defining musical [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29), which we will discuss later. For now, let's take the importance of the scale, especially the _major scale_, as a given, and look at the parts that make it up.
